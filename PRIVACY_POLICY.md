# Privacy Policy for AuraWake

**Last updated: December 12, 2024**

This Privacy Policy describes how AuraWake ("we", "us", or "our") collects, uses, and discloses your information when you use our mobile application (the "App").

## Information We Collect

### Permissions
We request the following permissions to provide the core functionality of an alarm clock and helper application:

*   **Alarms & Reminders (`SCHEDULE_EXACT_ALARM`, `USE_EXACT_ALARM`):**
    *   **Purpose:** To schedule and trigger alarms at the precise times you set.
*   **Notifications (`POST_NOTIFICATIONS`):**
    *   **Purpose:** To show you upcoming alarms, snoozed alarms, and other important alerts.
*   **Display over other apps (`SYSTEM_ALERT_WINDOW`):**
    *   **Purpose:** To ensure the alarm screen can be displayed even if your device is locked or you are using another application, guaranteeing you don't miss an alarm.
*   **Wake Lock & Full Screen Intent (`WAKE_LOCK`, `USE_FULL_SCREEN_INTENT`, `TURN_SCREEN_ON`):**
    *   **Purpose:** To wake up your device screen and keep the CPU running long enough to ring the alarm and allow you to interact with it.
*   **Vibration (`VIBRATE`):**
    *   **Purpose:** To vibrate the device when an alarm rings.
*   **Foreground Service (`FOREGROUND_SERVICE`, `FOREGROUND_SERVICE_MEDIA_PLAYBACK`):**
    *   **Purpose:** To play alarm sounds and ensure the alarm continues to function reliably in the background.
*   **Camera (`CAMERA`):**
    *   **Purpose:** To scan QR codes which may be used as a challenge to dismiss alarms. This data is processed locally on your device and is not transmitted to us.
*   **Boot Completed (`RECEIVE_BOOT_COMPLETED`):**
    *   **Purpose:** To automatically reschedule your set alarms when you restart your device.

### Usage Data
We do not collect personal usage data, browsing history, or location data. All alarm configurations and settings are stored locally on your device.

## How We Use Your Information
We use the permissions and data solely to:
*   Provide and maintain the App's functionality (ringing alarms, QR challenges).
*   Notify you of alarm events.

## Data Sharing and Disclosure
We do not sell, trade, or otherwise transfer your personally identifiable information to outside parties.

## Third-Party Services
If the App uses third-party libraries (e.g., for crash reporting or analytics in future updates), their use of information is governed by their respective privacy policies. Currently, the App operates primarily with local data.

## Children's Privacy
Our App does not address anyone under the age of 13. We do not knowingly collect personally identifiable information from children under 13.

## Changes to This Privacy Policy
We may update our Privacy Policy from time to time. Thus, you are advised to review this page periodically for any changes. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on this page.
